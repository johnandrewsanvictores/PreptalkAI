# D-ID Integration Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Stream Session Management

**Problem**: D-ID streams were timing out after 2-3 questions, causing 400 Bad Request errors.

**Solution**:

- Added stream health monitoring with age and request count tracking
- Implemented automatic stream reconnection when unhealthy
- Stream is considered unhealthy after 4 minutes or 20 requests
- Added `ensureHealthyStream()` check before each speak request

### 2. Error Handling & Recovery

**Problem**: Questions were repeating when errors occurred, and there was no fallback for API failures.

**Solution**:

- Added retry logic with up to 2 attempts per speech request
- Implemented fallback mode for when D-ID credits are exhausted
- Added proper error detection for 400/402 status codes
- Prevented duplicate speech attempts that caused repetition

### 3. Camera Setup Issues

**Problem**: Generic camera errors with no helpful information for users.

**Solution**:

- Added camera permission checks before requesting stream
- Implemented specific error messages for different failure scenarios
- Changed audio constraint to false (not needed for video-only)
- Added more flexible video constraints with minimum values
- Added manual retry button for camera issues

### 4. UI/UX Improvements

**Added**:

- Visual fallback mode indicator
- Better camera error display with specific messages
- Stream health information in console logs
- D-ID error display with dismiss button
- Connection status indicators on avatar

## Key Code Changes

### DIDStreamingService.js

```javascript
// Added stream health tracking
this.streamCreatedAt = null;
this.streamRequestCount = 0;

// Health check method
isStreamHealthy() {
  const streamAge = Date.now() - this.streamCreatedAt;
  const maxStreamAge = 4 * 60 * 1000; // 4 minutes
  const maxRequests = 20;
  return streamAge < maxStreamAge && this.streamRequestCount < maxRequests;
}

// Auto-reconnect before speaking
async ensureHealthyStream() {
  if (!this.isStreamHealthy()) {
    await this.reconnect();
  }
}
```

### InterviewPage.jsx

```javascript
// Retry logic for speech
const attemptSpeech = async (retryCount = 0) => {
  const maxRetries = 2;
  try {
    const result = await didSpeak(currentQuestionText, voiceId);
    if (result) {
      // Success
    } else {
      throw new Error("Speech failed");
    }
  } catch (error) {
    if (retryCount < maxRetries && !fallbackMode) {
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
      await attemptSpeech(retryCount + 1);
    } else {
      setFallbackMode(true);
    }
  }
};
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Long Interview Sessions**: Test with 10+ questions to ensure stream reconnection works
2. **Error Scenarios**: Test with invalid API keys or exhausted credits
3. **Camera Permissions**: Test with denied camera permissions
4. **Network Issues**: Test with intermittent connectivity

## Known Limitations

1. D-ID streams have a hard 5-minute timeout - we reconnect at 4 minutes
2. Each stream can handle a limited number of requests
3. Fallback mode provides text-only experience when API fails
4. Camera is optional - interview can proceed without it

## Future Improvements

1. Consider implementing WebSocket-based streaming for better reliability
2. Add analytics to track stream health and reconnection frequency
3. Implement progressive loading for avatar images
4. Add voice selection UI for different agents
